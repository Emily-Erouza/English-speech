 spirit of a people deeply connected to their roots.

 <!-- Food and drinks -->
 I love our Tsonga traditional food; it is not only delicious but also healthy, making it the best compared to other cultures' cuisines.
 In our Tsonga culture, we enjoy dishes like morogo (spinach) cooked with onion and spices, mopani worms, pumpkin porridge, dumplings, and samp mixed with beans.
  A key element of Tsonga food is pap (mealie), a stiff porridge made from maize meal.
 Meals are a significant part of Tsonga traditional food, with dishes like nyama (meat) and chicken feet being particularly enjoyed. Tsonga cuisine includes a 
 variety of dishes made from locally available ingredients such as beans, wild greens, and fruits like mangoes and avocados. Traditional beverages like mahangu (sorghum beer) 
 are also part of our culinary tradition, offering a refreshing drink during communal gatherings and celebrations.
 I cannot imagine life without our Tsonga traditional food; it is truly the best!

 <!-- Traditional healers sangoma -->

 when did sangoma started Swazi- and Shangaan-speaking peoples of southern Africa.

 What is the origin of the word sangoma?

What are the 3 sacred herbs?

 The process of becoming a healer often involves a calling or initiation, where an individual is believed to be chosen by the ancestors or spirits to carry on their tradition.
  The training encompasses learning about various medicinal plants, spiritual practices, and rituals. In particular, a Sangoma might undergo rituals to connect with ancestral 
  spirits and gain spiritual insight.
Tsonga traditional healers, known as "inyanga" and Sangoma, are respected figures within the community, playing a significant role in healthcare and spiritual guidance.
 These healers possess deep knowledge of traditional medical practices passed down through generations and are respected for their ability to heal both physical and 
 spiritual ailments.
   Traditional healers rely solely on 100% herbs, which they gather in bushes and mountains, guided by their guided.



   There are two main types of traditional healers within the Nguni, Sotho-Tswana, and Tsonga societies of Southern Africa:
    the diviner (isangoma) and the herbalist (inyanga). 


    most important thing to do in preparing muthi and healing. These practices include bathing, vomiting, steaming, nasal ingestion, enemas, and cuttings:[26]

Bathing – Herbal mixtures are added to bath water to purify the patient
Vomiting (phalaza) – A large volume (up to +-2 liters) of a weak, lukewarm herbal infusion is drunk and a process of self-induced vomiting occurs to cleanse and tone the system.
Steaming (futha) – Medicinal herbs are commonly inhaled by steaming them in a bucket of boiling water. A blanket is used to cover the patient and container. Hot rocks or a portable stove may be included to keep the bucket boiling. The patient sits under the blanket or plastic (preferably) as blankets get to absorb the heat and the steam does not rotate well, breathes in the herbal steam and sweats.
Nasally – A variety of plants can be taken dried and powdered as snuff. Some are taken to induce sneezing which may traditionally be believed to aid the expulsion of disease. Others are taken for the common conditions such as headaches.
Enemas – Infusions and some decoctions are commonly administered as enemas. The enema is a preferred route of administration of certain plant extracts, as it is believed they are more effective when administered this way.
Cuttings (ukugcaba) – Extracts or powders are directly applied to small cuts made with a razor blade in the patient's skin.

 <!-- Traditional healers are important poeples in the whole wide globe, because they use to heal some of sickness those can't be treated by our graduated doctors, 
 they work hand to hand this century.   -->


<!-- music and dance -->
Music and dance in Tsonga traditional culture go beyond mere entertainment; they play an integral role in storytelling, community gatherings, celebrations, and religious rituals.
Traditional instruments, such as drums and rattles, and rhythmic dances that often involve synchronized movements and footwork. 
These dance forms, performed in circles or lines, not only showcase artistic expression but also convey historical tales and legends. For instance, dances like xibelani,
 performed by women, exhibit movements with colorful skirts, celebrating femininity and grace.
 I feel honored to be a part of the Tsonga culture and take pride in sharing and teaching our traditional songs and dances to people from other cultures.


<!-- CONCLUSION -->
let us carry with us not just the melodies and movements, but the profound lessons embedded in every tradition. 
Let us be inspired by the communal spirit, the connection to the land, and the respect for the wisdom passed down through storytelling.
<!-- May this newfound understanding inspire us to continue fostering cross-cultural connections, promoting unity through diversity, and cherishing the unique expressions
 that make our world infinitely more fascinating. -->
 Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to share this exploration of my shared legacy and 
 for encouraging a world where every tradition is not only acknowledged but celebrated.
